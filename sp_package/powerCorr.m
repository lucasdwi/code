function [r,rVect] = powerCorr(psdTrls)
%% Calculates power correlations within frequency bands across channels
% INPUTS:
% psdTrls = power-spectra for each behavior of interest; format: structure
%   created by powerComp.m where each behavior is in its own cell with
%   .relPow as a field containing the relative power in each band for every
%   trial
%__________________________________________________________________________
% OUTPUTS:
% r = cell array of correlation values; format: cell array with 3D arrays
%   containing all correlation values (channel,channel,band)
% rVect = vectorized version of r; because of intrinsic symmetry of
%   correlation matrices, takes just lower half of matrix and puts into row
%   vector. For example, if 4 channels then the vector of r values will be
%   for the following correlations: 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 2-3, 2-4, and 3-4.
