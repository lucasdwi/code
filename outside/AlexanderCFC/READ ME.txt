Generalized Morse Wavelet Phase-Amplitude Coupling

This software package contains tools to compute and visualize phase-amplitude coupling using the generalized Morse wavelets [1], which are described elsewhere [2,3]. Example calls to the primary program, gmwCFC, are provided in the preamble to the code. 

Analysis overview:

1) gmwCFC: Compute modulation indices among a set of time-series using.
2) gmwCFCpermFDR: Generate null distributions by randomly pairing the phase of trial n to the amplitude of trial k, where n and k are pseudorandom integers, and computing the phase-amplitude coupling. For each observed MI, determine the probability of obtaining a value >= MI_obs by using the empirical cumulative distribution of random MIs. Significant MIs (with multiple comparison control) are determined using false discovery rate.
3) plotMIs: Plot comodulograms.

Note on Java files:

This program uses Java code written by Shinya Ito to bin amplitude values by phase. To use this program, the first line of gmwCFC (javaaddpath('/Users/Alexander/Documents/MATLAB/GMW CFC Public/crossfrequencycoupling.jar') must modified to include the location of crossfrequencycoupling.jar on the end users machine.
